# Rainbow-dock

DNS based service discovery for [docker](http://www.docker.com) inspired by [skydock](https://github.com/crosbymichael/skydock).

Basically use [rainbow-dns](https://github.com/asbjornenge/rainbow-dns) combined with something like [dnspop.js](https://gist.github.com/asbjornenge/95a83ea3ffdf083336a2) and :tada: you have a DNS server that can resolve container ip's based on names.

A more through description will be here soon...!! If not, [nag](https://github.com/asbjornenge/rainbow-dock/issues) me.
